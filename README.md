# Birdeatsbaby lyrics generator

Generates a new set of lyrics based on previously written lyrics.
Due to popular demand it now supports Feline & Strange lyrics as well. Make sure the domain is in the configuration file.

The current iteration uses Markov chains, which are probably the easiest way to do this. This is just step one.

A public instance runs on [bebgen.theimpossibleastronaut.com](https://bebgen.theimpossibleastronaut.com) and for Feline & Strange it's on [fsgen.theimpossibleastronaut.com](https://fsgen.theimpossibleastronaut.com).

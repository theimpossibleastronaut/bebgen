This storm is only in my mind. Beware.
Heavy air musty smell yellow clouds, a heaven like hell.
Chicks yawning lazy at the metro station – This is the thundergod's coronation.
The world sticks to me, follows every step, I drag it around, longing just for a nap.
As the thunder growls loudly the first time, Raindrops start to chime.
Thunderstorm-can you save me- Women and children first.
Lightning strikes, please please save me, Find me a shelter, it hurts.
I shriek and cover my head with my arm and run to a roof where nothing should harm.
And I wonder in the tiny edge of my brain: Why is nobody following? Are they insane?
I shrug and decide to do what I feel like and try to avoid the dashing hail's strike.
A small girl walks to me, seems unharmed by the ice.
Her mother runs fro, snashes her, that is wise.
Lightning strikes a crack in the earth don’t you see.
a gaping canyon ripping up straight to me.
When I realize that I'm crying still-I think I've got no free will.
Vaguely I check out some outstretched hand, They all look so worried I can understand.
I'm groping blindly for a strong hold And cry for help I am so cold.
It's raining cats and dogs and dragons and cones.
The crack approaches it reaches my bones.
I feel ripped in two and I'm falling Far far down Far down So far so far.

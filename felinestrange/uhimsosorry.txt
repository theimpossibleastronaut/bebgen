Yes, I admit, I am the bad one in this situation. And to think I wanted nothing from you but just a little appreciation.
When I hurled that glass at you I thought I'd miss you, honestly! Your eardrum split just because, well, you didn't listen properly.
Uh. I'm so sorry. Never meant to hurt you. Uh, I'm so sorry. Could we start anew?Uh, I'm so sorry, Can we talk it over? I'm so sorry, yes I am, it's true. I'm so sorry.
Maybe I should have done things in a different style. Well, my way has to get used to as you well know as our years go by.
True, was me who scratched your car but mundane things don't count at all! When I shot that gun at you I did mention it wasn't something personal.
Why should I apologise? I am what I am and this woman ain’t nice.
Take me as I am or go away, and don’t complain anymore if you decide to stay.
A pity I hurt you. a pity you sulk. When you started to cry I still wanted to talk.
You took me as I am and I like it that way. I won’t change I won’t stop I’ll die if you go away

I got another yellow letter – lawyer says I'm a bad girl.

In my lyrics I use the ABC and I never asked if that's OK.

I could change my style, I could pay the bill, I could say I'm sorry but I never will.

Mh-mh-mh I'm getting angry and I don't know what I will do.

Uh-oh-oh I'm getting angry I would be off if I were you.

Sound rules destroy my world as it has grown.

Make me a criminal for what I paid for on my own.

Can't you just leave – I'm trying to survive! let me live my life!

I'm not hurting you, why do you hurt me, I can let you live, why can't you let me?

Bankers don't care for future nor present nor past.

as long as their property is sure to last.

Who gives you the right to intrude in my life? Who justified?

I never asked for help, so please stay away,

I won't change my life cause you want me to pay.

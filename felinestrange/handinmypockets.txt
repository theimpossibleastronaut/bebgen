I've been watching for years now.
what people'll do just to spread their wings.
No one gives his place away.
I'll try to sit back and just watch them play kings.
there will be blood. there will be tears.
and there will be hate growing from fears.

I can't stand it, I won't change it. So I don't even stay.
I put my hands in my pockets and walk away.

Teach your child to be stupid.
defend your backyard world tooth and nail.
sue whoever's living in a different way.
slow down the world to the pace of a snail.
It's not my problem, so why should I care?
I'm too tired to fight harms I don't share.

do you think of the future. do you stop killing nature.
do you help a victim. do you forgo your dictum.
do you care what comes after. do you lose with laughter.
do you like your way to be. how do you without eyes to see.

With my hands in my pockets.
I feel strong and immune to tears.
I am nobody and nobody knows my name.
I`m closing my eyes to forget that I'm here.
may come the night. may come the end.
As I'm not in charge I won't raise a hand.

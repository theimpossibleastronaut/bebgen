Can't do maths, Can't drive, Don't like to carry heavy loads.
Can't dispute, Can't think angular, Am afraid of spiders and toads.
Without my lipstick I am broke, Who's got chocolate has won.
Without my handbag I feel naked, And it's weighing a ton.

Oh yes, I'm a woman. I have to admit: I'm a woman and I'm a real bitch.
I'm a woman and I'm no scam, I'm a woman, that's what I am.
Oh yes, I'm a woman and I love to be a real woman: you get what you see.
I'm a woman and I fit your clich√© of a real woman.

Like my clothes. like my home. like a good strong arm.
I'm a singer in a band, and my fist doesn't do any harm.
Too many shoes, too many bags, and a hell of a PMS.
A caress is the cure of my very worst fits.

Love to dance with my man and hate when he stays at home.
Go for looks, go for shoes, don't never go to the loo on my own.
Don't want to lay who's still there on three, but at four you should stay!
I'm allergic to everything, but the most to a bad hair day.

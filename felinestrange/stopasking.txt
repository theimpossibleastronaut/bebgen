I wish I could stop thinking about everything I do or see.
Why do I know what will happen, why do I feel responsible for everything I do?
I wish I could live peacefully without my conscience's gravity.
Not hear not see not talk a monkey toying with a typoscript that no one will read.

Let's stop asking who we are. stop asking where we go. stop asking who will care. stop asking.

I wish I could stop asking for the way you see the world.
I seem to be the only one to see it just the way I do, I watch and all seems so wrong.
Sometimes I wish I could turn back the time to know what I did not.
when I was young and thought the world was mine to loot not what to care for destined I was.

I want to be a lonely person, not responsible for you.
I wish you wouldn't ask me if I`m feeling like a woman after all who I am.
I don't want to replace myself with whom comes after, want to be.
my own remembrance own portrait, don't feel I have to trade that for a life, not at all.

Why canâ€™t I go on blindly.
Why do I have to speak up.
even if I know you won't listen.
and my voice blows in the wind like noise of.
dead transient sand.

I am the girl Who always knocks on locked doors. Uh, I forgot, did we have a date?
I am the girl Who sits amidst her blue balloons, Waits for the guests that never come To celebrate her birthday all alone.

Lonely girl. Don't pity me. Don't laugh at me lonely girl.
Lonely girl. Just comfort me. Be there for me. But you won´t be cause I´m a lonely girl (Lonely Girl).

I am the girl Last in the queue to wait for goods That are sold out the moment it's her turn. I am the girl Who never gets what she paid for Just accusations for the mess that other people did and walked away.
I am the girl Who cares that coffee´s made and cookies bought and mugs are rinsed when meeting starts. I am the girl Who cleans up after everyone And never gets a thankyou only has to clear her spot out of your hearts.

I am what's left. When you turn the stone and wait, All the spiders run away from me.
I am what's left. The last one at the party with that Never ending hope that life Will turn a fairy tale now after all.

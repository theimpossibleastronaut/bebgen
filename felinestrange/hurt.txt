Don't touch me. Your fingers burn like acid. Don't comfort me. What could you say that helps? Don't say a word. Your voice thrums like a lear jet.
My ears are sore from listening, They won't reload what you just said. They hurt Like hell.

I´m hurt. I´m hurt. my world is flaking. my heart is breaking. I´m hurt. words are making me hurt.

I don't need you, won't hold you. I can go on alone. Feel helpless, feel senseless But won't show it anymore. You're selfish you're godlike. I can't decide which one is true. My soul is aching from the load. Can't stand can't stay I run abroad- It hurts Like hell.

Don't you feel it. Don't you smell the smoke? Are you not afraid Of the backlash.
Don't you hear it coming. Don't you know its name. Don't you run yet. It will come for you, too.

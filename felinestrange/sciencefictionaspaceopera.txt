I've landed on this planet some dozen years ago.
but yet I didn't master life as one of its inhabitants.
I walk beside them and observe their strange behaviour.
which I don't fancy anymore. So now I'll leave!
I've built a little space ship around my lonely heart.
and right tonight at midnight I will launch my stellar start.
My life is science fiction, Endless spaces to explore.
I am this space ship's captain, go where no one's gone before.
I am this space ship's master, it's doing what I say.
I'm heading upwards to the sky, flying far away.
The streets are full of aliens with strangeness in their eyes.
Don't understand a word they speak.
don't know how I could blend me in.
If I could talk to you I'd tell you something:
what you heard, about your world, is nothing but lies.
I am a shipwrecked prisoner on a lonely isle.
Don't know where I'm belonging to,
no one seems to be missing me.
But now I know at least: I have a mission to fulfill.
End this planets misery and sweep it from the sky.
I've built my little space ship inside my wounded soul.
and right tonight at midnight will be launchtime for us all.
My life is science fiction, Endless spaces to explore.
I am this space ship's captain, go where no one's gone before.
I am this space ship's master, it's doing what I say.
and if I want to burn this planet comes your judgement day.

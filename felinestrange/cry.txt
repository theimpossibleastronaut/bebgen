You hurt me and you don't even know me. you make me crawl on the floor, hide under the bed. I've worked and I've worked, for so many dead hours, I've aged, I've resigned more times than I admit. Now I'm so tired I just want to cry.

With lawyers and lies you blame what I've created, try to steal what I made, what I love like a child, throw dirt in my face, let my friends turn their backs on me, make me the scapegoat in a game I don't like. I'm so angry I just want to cry.

To run and to hide makes the strongest soul crazy, but what's more: I can't run! I'm obliged to declare. After three hours sleep waking noonish seems lazy, The white feather sticks on my head like a flare. I'm so lonely I just want to cry.

Now I've grabbed my belongings and lift my head slowly and walk to the door and try if it will open and there they are scowling because they are envious, aiming their guns at my head to take what I can give.

The doubt is my frequent companion, how should I know if the shadow I throw is the truth? Your words, thoughtless bullets, tear into my heart, open up wounds that don't heal whatever I do. I'm so damaged I just wantto cry.

Iâ€™m tired, I'm sick of the world that I live in, I just want to stay put in my bed till I cease. but not even this to my kind will be granted, we have to take on your war while we want peace. I'm so frightened I can't even.

What will I be when I lose my bones?

What god carry me through waves of bitterness?

What shall I do when I'm down and out? Will you be there to drag me further?

I think not.

I'll die alone, all by myself.

Beauty is my profession – but what will happen the day I lose my eye?

I sing my own words but who will listen when my tongue goes dry?

I'll die alone, all by myself.

Will I remember flowers, will I remember rain?

will I remember birds and songs like when we were alive?

Will I remember feelings, Will I remember care?

will you remember who I was when I'm no longer there.

The moments I'm happy in life are while I'm dancing – but my legs are treacherous.

It's like my life's just beginning but the truth is hard and life is murderous.

I'll die so soon and all by myself.

We die and get born and we live and we die.

Sea forever churning on the Smugglers nest.
The nightly Sky is burning, the Wind comes from West.
The Water is blackening, the Rock looms high.
the Pharoa is a dead end and a Ship runs dry.
High is the rock and deep is the ocean,
Thin is the plank you're holding on.
Wide is the sea and shallow is the haven,
Many a sailor came and never got home.
So many dreams, a single tear: Go west from here.
Enfant terrible de la mer: The City by the sea.
N'est pas un rev√© mais c'est brutal, Go leave it all.
You came for heaven, this is hell: The city by the sea.
A Storm is coming, the tourists hide,
Rats and fugitives run prisonside.
The heat is overwhelming, the thirst never ends,
we all are strangers here with empty hands
Deep is the pocket and loud is the song,
Sparkling and rotten. The way home is long.
The city is dark but the streets invite to roam.
your money is gone and you can't ever go home.
Girls are swaying, their style is fresh.
Rich white boys are ogling their tanning flesh.
The DJ is tired but the night goes on.
The dancers are drunk and they won't ever go home.
Loud is the music and strong is the crowd,
You'll never find home, but the beach is about.
hard is the rock and soft is the sea.
Your mother the ocean takes you back into the deep.

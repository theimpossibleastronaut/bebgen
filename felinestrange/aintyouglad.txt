You had your chance To knock me out.
When you Had me crying On the floor.
I nearly Died when you Told me you're Off.
and Just a little Push would have Thrown me Over.
Well you know you Need me, Don't you try to Lie.
And I know you Want me, don't Need to play the Shy.
Shut Up now Babe you Had your SayAin't you Glad that I Called you Back when you Drove away that Night.
Hey boy, somebody had to |tell you what it Means to love and to be Loved.
and I tell you I might.
How could you smile at me over your pasta.
And tell me it's over, you don't love me no more.
I took you back as if nothing had been.
But I tell you don't play silly games anymore.

Let me lie upon my bad side.
Spat up on the floor.
Finger broken I am backwards.
Who could ask for more.

Crowned like cattle kick the habit.
Murder in the ranks.
Glory be to god above.
And money in the bank.

If it was easy would you leave me.
If it was easy you'd leave.

I have thought so many times.
The prophecy was you.
But if I did believe those rhymes.
We'd only blame the truth.

It's not as if you gave me.
Anything I didn't know.
But if you keep this to yourself.
I'll keep it for my own.

If it was easy.
Would you leave me.
If it was easy.
You'd leave.

Then I wake with an.
Awful taste in my.
Mouth has gone.
Cause she took my face to save herself.
From enemies like me.

Pray to god in heaven.
That he'll save you from your sins.
Every day I'm losing and you win.

I know what they said about you.
When you were alone.
Shut my mouth now seal it up.
It's shelter from the stones.
I will never deny you.
Their words become undone.
For now let me drink my trouble.
And the end will never come.

If it was easy.
Would you leave me.
If it was easy.
You'd leave.

Then I wake with an.
Awful taste in my.
Mouth has gone.
Cause she took my face to save herself.
From enemies like me.

Pray to god in heaven.
That he'll save you from your sins.
Every day I'm losing and you win.

Why don't you beg?
Why don't you beg?
Why don't you beg?
Why don't you beg?

Once we were happy.
I know it cause I saw.
You would say you loved me.
And you wrote it on the wall.
I know that your reasons were anything but right.
But I could be forgiving if you'd only oblige me.

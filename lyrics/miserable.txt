Well it's good to be a little open minded.
To the way that other people see the world.
But I can't get by your obsession with leather.
And the way you think it's fun to hurt yourself.

What's that skeleton inside your cupboard?
What's the use in hiding how you live?
What the use in being so damn secretive.
Your body's taken all that it can give.

She's got issues of the sexual kind.
Her happiness depends on being cuffed up and blind.
She's got problems cos she's desirable.
And it wouldn't matter much but you're miserable.

I can only imagine what you are thinking.
And my guess is that you haven't got a hope.
All those nights that you cannot remember.
If you keep on swallowing you're gonna choke.

While everyone behind your back is laughing.
Saying that you're running out of luck.
All those drugs and all that you've been drinking.
Half the time you're too drunk to fuck.

She's got issues of the sexual kind.
Her happiness depends on being cuffed up and blind.
She's got problems cos she's desirable.
And it wouldn't matter much but you're miserable.

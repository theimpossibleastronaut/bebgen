I drank the beast within.
I drank him down so deep.
He got so thin.
And then the beast within.
He learns to swim.
And so I cannot win.
Drink up, drink in.

These things have come to pass.

The trees have grown from seeds.
Theyâ€™re planted in my feet.
They crack my bones.
My spine becomes a branch.
To bend, not break.
So bend me back again, again, and then.

The life will come to pass.
My dull face in the dark.

I dared to heal and soon.
I soon forgot to feel.
The lights were on.
But everything was gone.
The beast he screams.
He begs upon his knees for me to run.

I run into his arms.
And I have come to pass.

I had to let him out.
Just once it was enough.
To take the doubt.
And turn it into truth.
The beast was free.
So guilty I will plea.

His hands among the stars.
Each one will come to pass.

The damage caused was great.
My love has turned to hate.
I beg for death.
But sleep will never come.
I curse the sun.
The beast and I are one.

My life has come to pass.
My dull face in the dark.
My life has come to pass.
I run into the dark.

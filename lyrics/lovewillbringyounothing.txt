Eight days ago he was down at my window.
Screaming my name in the air.
And by the sight I could tell he'd been drinking.
And when drunk you don't usually care.

That my situation had altered quite sharply.
Now my kisses don't come for free.
So throw down my hair for my lover to bear.
While my husband he wakes from his sleep and says.

Love will bring you nothing but despair.
Love will fill you with nothing but regret.

Out the next day on a fine sunny Sunday.
Walking the dog in the park.
He questioned my history and oh what a mystery.
Who was that man in the dark?

A jilted ex-lover but bad was my cover.
I am not one to outsmart.
But then he was silent I swallowed my lie.
Now be still my beating heart cos.

Love will bring you nothing but despair.
Love will fill you with nothing but regret.
But he was God to me.
He was God to me.

Back in my bed I was troubled with dreams.
While my husband slept soundly alone.
I wake at the breaking of glass and an aching that's.
Ringing through all of my bones.

I moved through the dark now I know this by heart.
In a trance I was that's what I'll say.
Draw blood from my feet every step is so sweet.
As I reached for his neck where he lay.

In the seconds that pass my dear breathing his last.
In pity I sink to the floor.
Now cut off my hair and with hours to spare.
I burn the house down.

Love will bring you nothing but despair.
Love will fill you with nothing but regret.
But he was God to me.
He was God to me.

Through ten walls you gently breathe.
A rhythm only known to you and me.
I would scratch these bricks away.
So through the hollows you can hear me say.

I have seen your misery.
You've always had a hold over me.
Eyes so wide to blind the fates.
But your sleep has kept so awake.

Through ten walls you rest alone.
Buried shallow under precious stone.
It won't be too long before.
Guilty hands come knocking on your door.

Now you rise, you have become.
A symbol of all I cannot trust.
I may make these mountains move.
But you turn them to dust.

It's the life you chose and how.
The years have frozen you my darling.
How the consequences of your actions.
Lead us to sever and betray.
I know.

It's not like I'll ever know.
If you and I could roll away the stones.
I can't give up my beliefs in who we are.

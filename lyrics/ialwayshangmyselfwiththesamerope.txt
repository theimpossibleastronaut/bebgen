You once cut a friendly figure haunting and bereft.
Now you cast an ugly shadow guilty and obsessed.

So why must you always play the victim.
It's time that I wasn't your hero.
I've got troubles of my own that you used to care for.
Now all I desire is to run so far away.
From those open and angry arms.
I am not your possession.

Now I once tried to love you dearly, compromised my heart.
But I paid the price and clearly I have played my part.

So cry if you want to but the blood runs cold.
Cold to the touch and cold to your bones.
I shudder from your empty tears now.
Call me anything you want to justify this situation.
That's all in your mind now.
Come on be a man about it so.

Why tell the truth.
When it's easier to put the blame on you.
I was bored with no hope.
But I always hang myself with the same rope.

Now I dress in sorry silence wearing all my pain.
Now you think you're caving in.
Well violence is my friend.

So how can you blame this all upon me.
I tried but my patience is wearing.
Thin and as I give you keep on taking.
Take me off the pedestal that you've created.
And you'll see that now you.
Hate me is this the only way?

So Why tell the truth.
When it's easier to put the blame on you.
I was bored with no hope.
But I always hang myself with the same rope.

Dead round the eyes red rings what a sight there.
Prone to the thoughts of electric nightmares.
Soft like a skin yes I grin if I have to.
You've got to, you've got to go.

Swim little fish get away from the lobsters.
Quick here they come they're relentless monsters.
Drown if you have to, don't share the secret.
Don't share it, don't share it.

Rich men walk through the eye of a needle.
Poor men limp on a dog that's feeble.
I know a path that is quick and evil.
Now I've got to Flog That Horse.

Never comes a day so quickly when you're not paying attention.
Never comes a day so quickly when you never leave the lights on.
Never comes a day so quickly when you're not paying attention.
Never comes a day so quickly when you never leave the lights on.
The lights on the lights on.

My left hand is a whip and a bandage.
Free to choose where the mark or brand is.
Each one knows how to hide in the carnage.
They're hiding, they're hiding.

Time's running out for the rats in the playground.
Cut straight down like a thief in a small town.
Shots rack em up, pin a tail on the donkey.
You've got a lot to answer for.

Crawl on your knees like a bitch we can see you.
Cut through the trees with your claws and your tutu.
Quick drag me back through the dirt that I came from.
God please let me flog that horse.

Never comes a day so quickly when you're not paying attention.
Never comes a day so quickly when you never leave the lights on.
Never comes a day so quickly when you're not paying attention.
Never comes a day so quickly when you never leave the lights on.
The lights on the lights on.

Don't play games with the ones who can buy you.
Don't play games with ones you can lie to.
Life seems strange when there's no one to cry to.
You're crying, you're crying.

Watch in the sky for the wrath of your captor.
You'll fall flat if you run any faster.
Don't look back for the fear of their laughter.
They're laughing, they're laughing.

Crawl on your knees like a bitch we can see you.
Cut through the trees with your claws and your tutu.
Quick drag me back through the dirt that I came from.
God please let me flog that horse!

Never comes a day so quickly when you're not paying attention.
Never comes a day so quickly when you never leave the lights on.
Never comes a day so quickly when you're not paying attention.
Never comes a day so quickly when you never leave the lights on.
The lights on the lights on.

Never comes a day so quickly when you're not paying attention.
Never comes a day so quickly when you never leave the lights on.
Never comes a day so quickly when you're not paying attention.
Never comes a day so quickly when you never leave the lights on.

Hail Mary full of grace.
The Lord has put you in your place.
Put you where no-one can reach.

No hands to touch or words to speak.

Have you had your fill of misery?
For the light it falls so far from me.
But it's my sin, there is no shame.
I close my eyes, I see the flames.

Hail Mary of the earth.
They promised you a virgin birth.
They take your name and they conspire.
To burn you with their holy fire.

But if you lead so many to believe.
Their death is not a mystery.
They'll bring their arms and bring their guns.
For the Lord he speaks but not in tongues.

We're fighting for the rest of us.
This sacrifice is not enough.
To justify our history.
Oh Mary, please come home to me.

Hail Mary in your arms.
The ashes of a fallen star.
You only have to break the spine.
For the Lord is good, and he is kind.

Have you had your fill of righteousness?
For the light it falls so far from us.
If we can't stop the acts of man.
To save ourselves then no-one can.

We're fighting for the rest of us.
This sacrifice is not enough.
To justify our history.
Oh Mary, please come home to me.

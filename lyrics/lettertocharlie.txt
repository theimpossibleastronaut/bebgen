Tie me down Charlie Brown.
Wrap me up in a hospital gown.
I'll suck your thumb.
Eat bubblegum and cry alone in the dark.

The dark worries me does it bother you?
But I am the walrus I am the truth.
Stealing lines, side-step the mines.
Jump on a crack.
Break your mother's back.

Eight track telepack.
Tap her head and watch it crack.
Read what you can dream what you don't.
The oblivious headaches and the bitter barbiturates.
Curl in a ball learn to love the restraints.

Well it's hard to feel rejected when your head is a stone.
Look at me and what I have done.

Losing is something you do well but you always play to chase.
Staying up 'til the sun comes up and your eyeballs look so strange.
You will say what they want you to and never disagree.
The new girl looks just like you but she has bigger teeth.

Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! It's over!
Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Say that it's true!
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Now cos she's leaving.
She's a substitute.

For once take the mask away.
We can see your face has changed.
You could have been so intelligent.
But you eat the scraps again.

You will dress how they want you to and match them drink for drink.
Cross my eyes and hope to die you've never learned to think.

Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! It's over!
Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Say that it's true!
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Now cos she's leaving.
She's a substitute.

Hang them high.
We'll crack the sky.
And watch them kicking.

Dear, it's fair.
That although you tear.
No one's questioning your grace.

Sleep all day 'til the stars come out.
And you dare to show your face.
You will wait 'til they left the room.
To cover it with flames.
Nothing hurts more than the burn.
But it's a worthy gain.

Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! It's over!
Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Say that it's true!
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Now that she's leaving.
She's a substitute.

Hang them high.
We'll crack the sky.
And watch them kicking.

Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! It's over!
Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Say it! Say that it's true!
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Now that she's leaving.
She's a substitute.

We lost your face in clouds of blue.
We met your friends and the people you knew.
But they were like shadows and emptiness.
They like to remember what you try to forget.

The season was summer when we passed through the town.
They opened their hearts to us while we played to the crowd.
We pray for remembrance or just for the couch.
From one hand to another we fade into the black.

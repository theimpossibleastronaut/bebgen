Honey, Sugar, Lover, Ever.
Baby this one is for you.
Alcoholic, so catastrophic.
You gave me something to do.

You tie me up in a ball in a cup in a black Cadillac.
In the box of a Jack.
In a moment of truth in a mistaken youth.
I am tragically yours in a page in a book.

Sweetheart, my darling, slightly charming.
Wrap me in nettles and thorns.
Precious letters, maybe it's better.
If you had never been born.

You come inside like a victory bride.
But you're all dressed in crimson and blacked out your eyes.
And so exaggerated so much that you rip at the seams.
And I tear out the dice on your lips.

Headache, staring.
Toothache tearing.
Earthquake, bearing.
How am I meant to believe.
Â…in someone quite like you.
I know once you loved me too.
The price you pay is critical.
Why did I stay? It's pitiful.

Incoherence, my disappearance.
Where did my dignity go.
Daytime nightmares- get your fair share?
No, well I didn't think so.

You slip away into slumber I lay and I crumble and pay.
For the price on your head and I hate to admit.
That your conscience is clear when you.
Know what you did and you won't she'd a tear.

Shaking, burning, in-the-grave turning.
Burden your demons on me.
Seething, writhing, raging, caving.
See how I split into three.

Ivory runs as the night overcomes.
And I'm left with the cold and the dark.
And the numbness so unsympathetic.
I said no I meant it.
I pointlessly argue my case as defendant.

Headache, staring.
Toothache tearing.
Earthquake, bearing.
How could you go make me bleed?
On someone quite like you.
I know once you loved me too.
But the price you pay is critical.
Why did I stay?
It's goddamn fucking pitiful.

So do you still.
Think of me.
While you're masturbating slowly over Kiera on TV.
Clinging on.
There's hope at hand.
Is your last romantic question, would you sleep with a dying man?

But it's the end.
Last curtain call.
Now the band is breaking up and your big heart is feeling small.
Now that you're sick.
You don't belong.
Every colour that you loved for right is wrong.

But it's not over.
Like I told you.
What's another drink to settle any argument?

And how I wish.
That you'd get thin.
And as shallow as I am, that is a sin.
You never knew.
I hate inside.
Did you think I told you truthfully, cause every one was a fucking lie.

And at the end.
I will not call.
You'll be the only one to blame, and the only one to fall.
Now that you're sick.
You don't belong.
Now then here's a song about you, are you happy that you're wrong?

But it's not over.
Like I told you.
What's another drink to settle any argument?

I've got a mind to hurt you now.
Forgive me while I take a bow.
Cause I know deep down in your heart this must be killing you.
I watch you walk away.
So happy that I'll never say: Keep your mouth shut darling because I know where you live.

I danced at your wedding.
For the bride and the groom.
I danced through the shadows.
And I danced in that room.

And I gave up salvation.
Just to dance at your death.
I waited there and I held my breath.

I danced on the pavements.
But I stepped on the cracks.
It hard to dance with the devil on your back.
And I looked up to heaven.
But the angels replied: You will dance till the day you die.

But don't be afraid my dear.
Close your eyes and dry your tears.
I will not forget you and I will not lie.
I will dance till the day I die.

I danced over water.
But I drowned in the sea.
Devils swam all over me.

And I fell through the darkness.
Right to the deeps.
Swallowed whole while the angels weep.

But don't be afraid my dear.
Close your eyes and dry your tears.
I will not forget you and I will not lie.
I will dance till the day I die.

I will not forget you and I will not lie.
I will dance till the day I die.

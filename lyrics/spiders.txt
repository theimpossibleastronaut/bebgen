He wasn't much took at.
But words the spider spun.
The girls around in circles.
One by one by one.

And by the second winter.
He was gone again.
And I'll never let my guard down.
Till it's said and done.
And you're no harm to anyone.

It's a bad life you chose to lead.
And the same stars hang over me.
You're like a sad child.
No one wants to leave.
But we left you in the cold.

And a thousand steps behind you.
Wrong place wrong time.
We will rise up to fight you.
And keep you in line.

And you can drag your slow lips up.
All over this town.
But I'll never let myself down.
Till your hands are bound.
And you're no threat to be around.

It's a bad life you chose to lead.
And the same christ hangs over me.
You're like a sad child.
No one wants to leave.
Left you in the cold.

Cold, cold, cold, cold.
Cold, cold, cold, cold.

It's a bad life you chose to lead.
And the same skies hang over me.
You're like a sad child.
No one wants to leave.
Left you in the cold.

It's a bad life you chose to lead.
And the same life hangs over me.

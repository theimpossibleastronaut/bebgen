Waste my time and suffer this.
Weight of envy weak in bliss.
All strung out under these eyes.
Captive by my own device.

Heaven speaks a different tongue.
Yours is silver and undone.
Taste like sulphur and of soot.
Hanging by these tenterhooks.

Drag me up from under dust.
Shake me wake me up.
To just pull me back under.
My wishful thinking.
Head on a plate for a stranger.
I've said too much.
I'm rolling in sickness.
I dragged you up into this lust.
We must face the thunder.

You can't see the woods for the trees.
You can't see the woods for the trees.
The bitch was all over me.

You got me hanging by tenterhooks.
You got me hanging by tenterhooks.

Leave your scars I want you to.
Creep the lines the edge of you.
I will beg for what you took.
Hanging by these tenterhooks.

Drag me up from under dust.
Shake me wake me up.
To just pull me back under.
My wishful thinking.
Head on a plate for a stranger.
I've said too much.
I'm rolling in sickness.
I dragged you up into this lust.
We must face the thunder.

You can't see the woods for the trees.
You can't see the woods for the trees.
The bitch was all over me.

You got me hanging by tenterhooks.
You got me hanging by tenterhooks.

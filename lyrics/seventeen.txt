When I was seventeen.
I met a man.
Gave him all my dreams.
Told him all my plans.

Plans to rule the earth.
Plans to tear apart.
Plans to be the queen.
Of his broken heart.

The sorrow is.

When I was seventeen.
I met a boy.
And together we would dream.
But always destroy.

So in love with his pain.
Turning deathly pale.
He would always reign.
In our fairytale.

The sorrow is.

Young and full of pride.
We raged and spat and screamed.
Put out all their eyes.
Never let them see.

His heart was always drunk.
Pity for the ones.
The ones who knew him well.
Now I never will.

When I was seventeen.
He took me in his arms.
And he swore on to me.
To keep my safe from harm.

But everything must end.
And everyone must pay.
My fairytale friend.
He only fades away.

When I was seventeen.
I met a man.
Gave him all my dreams.
Told him all my plans.

Now I'll never tell.
All that I have seen.
And we said farewell.
When I was seventeen.

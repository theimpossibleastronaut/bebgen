Arms of the mother will keep you in grace.
Our generation's no mirror to face.
Chemical progress is sure to erase.
The anchors of history keep us in place.

It's hard to tell them apart from the flies.
It's hard to stand upright under their lies.
An island surrounded by coastlines of eyes.
They want surrender.

Eyes in the mirror.
Eyes in the dust.
I'm not the sick one.

Watching the stakes growing higher and higher.
Watching the rats as they lie and conspire.
All of these oceans to put out the fires.
Ashes to ashes our funeral pyre.

If you believe that you've been led astray.
See that the mirror is taken away.
Would you still choose to remain in a cage?
Would you surrender.

Eyes in the mirror.
Eyes in the dust.
I'm not the sick one.

Now nothing's the same as it was.
And the wolf has come right to my door.
I'll forsake myself to the claim.
That I just don't believe anymore.

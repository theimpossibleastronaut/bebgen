Dark comes down.
On the darkest part of town.
And a gentleman steps out.
Into the night.

I was walking home.
Such a silly girl, all alone.
And we met by the river.
I knew he was and oh God.
I shiver.

I recognized.
There was sadness in his eyes.
And a longing I despise.
Turning me old.

Hearts so cold.
Save my soul.
If I just give in.
It will not be my fault it will just be a sin.

Now morning (morning, morning).
Comes like a baby.
Born of mourning (mourning, mourning).
Mourning for me.
I’ve been calling (calling, calling).
All of my sisters into the fire.
And they’re warning (warning, warning).
Burning alive.

One! Two! Three! Four!.

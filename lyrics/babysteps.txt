She came to me with baby steps, at first.
I could not see this blessing it was a curse.
Her eyes are hollow like an open grave.
I cannot help myself, I am to blame.

I gave the baby too much milk to drink.
Then it got greedy and learned how to think.
I see it crawling out an open grave.
I cannot help myself, I am to blame.

It's more than I could ever ask of you.
It's more.
It's more than I could ever take from you.
It's too much, more.

I rock your cradle till the splinters come.
I tie you up until you come undone.
We'll think it over, in your open grave.
I cannot help myself, I am to blame.

It's getting easier to hide from you.
I set the trap and watch you run into.
All my obsession coming down in spades.
I cannot help myself.

It's more than I could ever ask of you.
It's more.
It's more than I could ever take from you.
It's too much, more.

You never punished me, it's too late.
Why don't you keep away?
I've been so tired but awake.
While you keep counting down.

It's more than I could ever ask of you.
It's more.
It's more than I could ever take from you.
It's too much, more.

Seventy steps to the lighthouse we crept.
On the morning after the night before.
Seventy steps up the tower.
Her hair like Rapunzel.
It's more than I can bear.

How we dreamed of oceans deep.
We'll make them sink.
We'll go to sleep.
And how we prayed.
We prayed for days.
But no one came to save us.
But the saints will protect us.

Seventy times we were warned by our mothers.
The danger, temptation, we guide you home.
Seventy spirits of Solomon.
Crawling up the coastline.
We're begging to break this spell.

How we dreamed of oceans deep.
We'll make them sink.
We'll go to sleep.
And how we prayed.
We prayed for days.
But no one came to save us.

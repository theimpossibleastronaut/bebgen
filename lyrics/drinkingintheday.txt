Drinking in the day and I will again tomorrow.
Drinking in the day, I'll be drowning all my sorrow.
And I know that you've been stepping over me.
And I know that home is ever far from me.
Drinking in the day and I will again tomorrow.

I've always been afraid of the things I've had to run from.
But god I miss the grey skies of England.
Gotta keep me moving, I cannot go to sleep.
And deliver me safely away from all my dreams.
Drinking in the day and I will again tomorrow.

And lord knows I tried long as I tried.
Lord knows I tried long as I tried.

Drinking in the day.
Drinking in the day.

I used to have a purpose but now I'm only.
Drinking in the day.

I used to have a purpose but now I'm only.
Drinking in the day.

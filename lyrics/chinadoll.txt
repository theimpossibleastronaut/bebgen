He wakes up to shave with a rusty razor blade.
That dim reflection says that he's a man today and not a boy.
Which until previously had been employed.
By those who know.

It's a pleasure.
And oh you're a treasure.
I feel better.
With just a measure of.

Poison for the lady who's expecting his dear baby.
And it's only a matter of time.

Till he wakes up face down on the bedroom floor.
And his wallet is gone and it's almost four.
He meant to meet the girl.
But it seems that someone else.

Took initiative.
In fulfilling this.
And you won't forgive.
Such a sensitive.

Subject for her slim physique.
I wish to hold my tongue but speak, cause.

It's not a baby, It's a china doll.
You've got some nerve, you're never here at all.

She tells you maybe just to make you fall.
But she's no lady she's just mean and.

Cruel to be kind.
And saintly inside.

Now I need to lay my head down to rest.
This situation's gone from a mockery into a mess.
She's not your type I understand.

It's not that easy to let it go.
And you'll never know.
How to take it slow.
And be comfortably.

Blind to all her cruel convictions.
Shame that you can't see that.
She's playing you all for a fool.

She's got a bone to pick with everyone I know.
So stop Your crying there below, cause.

It's not a baby, it's a china doll.
You've got some nerve, You're never here at all.

She tells you maybe just to make you fall.
But she's no lady she's just mean and.
Not my problem.

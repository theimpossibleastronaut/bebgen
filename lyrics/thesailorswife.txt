The sailor's wife, alone one night.
In slumber as she bathes.
She dreams of ships her sailor's lip.
Against the ocean waves.

The sailor's wife was pale and white.
Beauty near divine.
Oh how the sea has stolen thee.
She drinks, she waits, she cries.

Life is but a dream.

The sailor knows that waves will grow.
When all is not content.
The sky grows dark, a lightening spark.
A message must be sent.

He shouts down to the sorry crew.
The sky's no longer blue.
A storm is come to claim someone.
So pray it is not you.

Life is but a dream.

The sailor's wife had bare a life.
Before she slipped and fell.
Her back was broke, and as she soaks.
She cannot cry for help.

The sailor clings to ropes and things.
He won't survive for long.
Then crashing down upon his crown.
A final, parting song.

Both of them sinking as death pulls the plug.
One in the ocean and one in the tub.

The water's running.
The storm is coming.
The sailor is drowning, drowning.

Life is but a dream.

I'm invited to the feast of hammers.
Led like cattle to the bride.
If you're dumb or lonely, you can come and join me.
But I warn you, you'll be crucified.

I'm invited to the feast of hammers.
Sacrificed and happy to be paid.
Like dull creatures, they will beg to beat her.
And I cannot help but do the same.

Do you know what's needed?
Growing underneath it.
If you keep on hammering on.

See my sister, she is cold and distant.
She's been hanging from the chandelier.
See my brother, he was bled for another.
While the milk of kindness hides in here.

Now we're winning, in this game of drowning.
And the walls are crumbling to the earth.
Soon we'll see it, and for one sweet minute.
We will have some purpose and some worth.

And if you listen.
You will hear them quicken.
You can hear them hammering, hammering on.

I am punished divine.
I am broken so fine.
And my battle is won.

Will you count to seven.
Will you keep this hidden.
Will you keep on hammering, hammering on.

Waking up cold in the morning.
Gotta keep moving, gotta keep breathing.
Keep sucking through my teeth.
I am alive, but for the time being.
I never wanted anything but this.
So don't let me down.

Let me have what I want.
Just once it's enough to pick me up.
Kick me out, steal back the vanity.
Now we are kept buried like dead.
I never wanted anything but this.

But I could try.
Silence is our master.
Try.
Silence is our master.

Speak now, throw your words on me.
It's a red flag begging for a fight.
Whip crack leave a mark upon the skin.
Perfect love is bare.
And I never wanted anything but this.
So don't let me down.

Always in the way I'm in a state.
I'm in your slaughterhouse.
So thet the blood turn the water red.
And never let them out.
See the sights, ten billion lives.
Their hearts and souls separating.
At the speed of light.

Silence is our master.
Try.
Silence is our master.

The ghosts in my house.
Are whispering and calling out to me.
They wake me up at first light.
The nightmare it's coming home.

Here lies the one you gave up on.
Not good enough.
Not good enough.

The ghosts in my house.
Are laughing at me.
The living can never be free.
They wake me up just to go back to sleep.
So I'm living in a permanent dream.

This house will fall in drunken scrawls.
Not good enough.
We had it all.

So don't try to leave.
Cause you promised me.
So don't try to leave.
Cause you promised me.

Here lies the one you gave up on.
Not good enough.
Not good enough.

How I'd like to shake this body off.
I want to adore the hands that hate us all.
My darling there must be pieces missing.
Drink to us and swear to tell no one.
What becomes of you.

How I'd like to shake this body off.
A feather to the storm.
The hands that break the soul.
They will keep us spinning.
Now you're saying things you've never meant.

We're really not so different.
We'll isolate the enemies.
And make them helpless just like me.
I'm like my father, sire, father, liar.
Father, sire, father, liar.

How I'd like to shake this body off.
And to scratch away these thorns.
The hands that will not hold.
And they will not help us.
Now I sleep at night.

How do the hands keep bearing down on me?

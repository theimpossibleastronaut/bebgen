It must be time to go.
Now you can say that you told me so.
Stay a little more time for a standing ovation.
Won't you take pride in this rare sensational victory.
You're pretending.

You've always been such a contradiction.
And I dare not tell you every affliction.
That borders on madness and keeps us from speaking.
Keeps us in moments that keep repeating my memories.
Never ending.

There's not a soul here to deny me.
But I leave unknown.
Always a line here to remind me.
How I linger on.

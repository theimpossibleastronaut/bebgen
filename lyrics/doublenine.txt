You the centre and the colour of my eyes.
Double nine.
You taught me how to see everything between.
Knife filled eyes.

My favourite and my best.
Well there is no contest.
The worst you ever did.
I want to bless.

I've been so lost since the skin upon my soul.
Was fierce and bold.
You knew the truth but God forbid any of your friends.
Are ever told.

Don't say that we're the same.
You know the stars can lie.
You've been a joyful blame for all my life.

Well what's that got to do with anything?
You don't know me like you should and.
Nothing's ever good enough for you.

Well I can scratch until I'm smooth until my hands are.
Blistering and bruised.
And I see you.

You've been an inspiration and an awful pain.
You'll always be afraid of your own name.

I beg you not to tell, as if you ever would.
Now don't forget to be what I never could.

Those sleepy eyes.
You've been up all night.
He won't call.
You can't make him care at all.

Jacqueline.
It's just the little things.
He makes you do.
He'll tear you in two.

Remember when we used to sing our song.
He will never let you belong.

You're going blind.
We moved away.
Your house is now your prison.
You're heart's gone grey.

You've gone too far.
And I can't tell.
I guess you're old enough now.
To go to hell.

Remember when we used to sing that song.
He'll never let you belong.
Remember when we used to sing that song.
He'll never let you belong.
Remember when he breaks your heart.

He's all alone, Stuck to the ceiling.
Chewing my bones, eliminate feeling.

I wasn't there, Why should I care?
He shivers brightly and ever so nicely.

It's not a please, More of a must.
So if you please, So if you must.

I wasn't there, Why should I care?
He shivers brightly and ever so nicely.

But I don't give a damn.
A man is just a man.

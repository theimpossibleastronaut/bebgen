The fever that falls is the one that will rise again.
Secrets are mine but I won't tell anyone.
Mine is a vice, such inconvenience.
Picture me now when my motives are meaningless.

Stubborn and tired, things I can never know.
Unsatisfied, I have so far to go.
When can I sleep, sink into nothingness.
Fighting my way through the wretched unhappiness.

Dear don't tie me down.
I belong on another side.
With no more reason to fight.
Fade into the blue.
My arms will open wide.

Speeches to speak, always been spoken to.
If I could wait, sure I'd be open to.
Many's the sign, put my trust in anyone.
And I'd do the time cause there's nothing I haven't done.

Merit's no cure and no remedy.
I've no more faith and no precious memories.
Sorry I failed you and we should've won.
But I feel like it's over before it's begun.

Even gone, he fails me now.
Stuck on another side.
With all of his reasons to hide.
Fake it till it's true.
My arms will open wide.

Your love is so pure.
And mine is so tainted.
Will I be the strangest.
Sink into the floor.
My arms will open wide.

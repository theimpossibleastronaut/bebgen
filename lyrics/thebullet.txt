Tired of the bullet, you laid out your life.
In selections of photographs hung up to dry.
Shoot through the middle and gather your points.
By protecting yourself from another bad choice.

No one will care if you put out that light.
You built an army but they would not fight.
So then speechless and void, you're just a memory.
Stuck in the mirror with no exit strategy.

You should move on, make a life of your own.
Get happily married and live in a home.
But you can't sit still and you're certain it's true.
There's just too many them and just not enough you.

You're a rat in a cage, you're a bull in a china shop.
Took center stage for the world just to spit you up.
I say let's shoot back.

Heaven above us and hell just behind.
Nobody knows it, I'm just one of a million kinds.
So sing if you're sorry for all that you see.
Sing if you're just the same as me.

Looking back now there's no way I would do.
Anything different or anything new.
You and me both we're the bullet within.
We're just playing a game that nobody can win.

So I'll burn all my promises, never agree.
To become what I hate and then hate what I see.
I'm as empty as all of the air that I breathe.
And I'm hollowed and fraught but at least I still bleed.

Help me remember that once you were here.
Living without you, it's just one of a million fears.
So I'll keep on singing this lullaby.
Darling how deep does the bullet lie.

How deep does the bullet lie.
How deep does the bullet lie.
How deep does the bullet lie.
How deep does the bullet lie.

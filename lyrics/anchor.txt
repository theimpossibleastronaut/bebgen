I have tried to back down in the eyes of strangers.
They will know my all.
That my pride comes after a fall, a fall.
Then you begin to ask the questions to end questioning.
Why the art is growing silent in my arms.

It's a long a way to the anchor.
Fathoms under water.
You are running out of breath to carry.
Your lungs are not ready.
It's not enough to save me.
And you don't have the strength of many.

I denied, I smiled, I swallowed like a willing child.
I saw you guessed but you could never save a sinking shipwreck.
Don't be upset, it's just you haven't worked it out yet.
There's still time just don't be blameful if you don't have mine.

It's a long a way to the anchor.
Fathoms under water.
You are running out of tricks to tempt me.
Even if you move me.
I'd still be a greedy little thing.
To have around and watch you drowning.

Come home to me, I won't be grateful but I will not leave your side.
And I'll be the anger you have always known it's me.
So now you've won, just let the water fill your lungs.
I'll watch and pray cos everybody has to die someday.

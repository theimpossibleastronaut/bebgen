I'm wicked like a stranger crawling over your bed.
Wicked like the criminal inside of your head.
I'm wicked like the sickness in a cold fever sweat.
Wicked like the taste of each and every regret.

I'm wicked like the preacher preying on innocence.
Fumblin' his creeping fingers under your dress.
I'm wicked like the bodies hidden under cement.

If my body is a temple, desecrate me.

And I don't want nobody else.
I'll be your tiger in a cage.
I'm going to keep you to myself.
Oh no.
And I don't want nobody else.
I'll be your tiger in a cage.
I'm going to keep you to my (it's my body, my body).

I'm wicked like the serpent coming out of the tree.
Whisper in your ear until you wake up and bleed.
Wicked like the things I say but I don't mean.
Wicked now I know the devil's working in me.

So wicked that you'll wake up screaming out my name.
Take away your purity and leave you with shame.
You know I'll leave you when I've nothing to gain.

So baby if my body is a temple, desecrate me.

I was once a child of God but then the devil kissed me.
He gave me fear, and he said my dear.
God will never miss thee.

There's a price upon my head, and I've gone.
Can the righteous still be lead by the wrong?

I've been waiting for better days, but a cold wind keeps on blowing.
If I confess, they say I'm blessed but my dark heart keeps on growing.

Did you want me to pretend?
Carry on.
I'll never be your friend or belong.

When I think back to sons I knew, that now I have forgotten.
That sweet taste of sympathy, the taste of something rotten.

I've been losing all my life.
In the shame.
You would beg me to survive without blame.

Take me back with open arms I know you can't resist me.
My sweetest kiss, I tell you this.
God, he didn't miss me.

Victoria, I hate to be the one to tell you this.
But it's gone beyond.
Everyone's idea of a joke.
I know you're here.
On every surface I smell you near.
The scent of cigarettes and Belvedere.
Victoria.

Morning came, you changed your name.
Into a V.
No one knows.
What you saw, that made your poor heart bleed.

Triumphantly.
You did declare your only love was me.
So how could he shut you away?

But when I sing.
That's when I end and then you begin.
It's sickening in a curious way.

But he was strong, his arms were longer than yours.
What a cruel finishing, the punishing.
Just to be sure.

Well he'll know your name.
And I now I know I can feel your pain.
Again and again and again.
What have I done?

My cell is cold.
I am so empty and unconsoled.
Out of the centerfolds.
Victoria.

I was alive, so many times.
Under your spell.
It's just as well.
You are gone, I won't be wronged in hell.

All of your ashes still burning.
Voices that call in the night.
I feel as if I have carried you all of my life.

Victoria, I will remember nothing else.
Victoria, you were the one.
